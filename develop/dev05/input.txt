1. This is a sample text file for testing the grep program with various flags.
2. You can use the -A (after) flag to print +3 lines after a match.
3. Similarly, the -B (before) flag can be used to print +2 lines before a match.
4. The -C (context) flag combines -A and -B and prints Â±4 lines around a match.
5. You can also use the -c (count) flag to get the count of matching lines.
6. The -i (ignore-case) flag allows you to ignore case while matching.
7. To invert the match, use the -v (invert) flag.
8. The -F (fixed) flag matches the exact string, not a pattern.
9. Use the -n (line num) flag to print line numbers along with matching lines.
10. End of the file.
